In order to be specific about the parameters which need your attention, we would like to brief about the parameters which need your input for creating a network

> *   **Mode**
>     *   Demo Mode: If you opt this, then you would be able to create a network with single instance only. In case if you want to do like unit testing or learning or giving demo, then this option is for you! We are not restricting you to use this for the mentioned option, this is your platform and you can use it anyways.
>     *   Production Mode: If you opt for this, then you can go with as many nodes as you want to be included in your network.
