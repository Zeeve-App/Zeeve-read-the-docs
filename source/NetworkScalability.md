# Network Scalability

Zeeve allows you to scale up your network after it has been bootstrapped. Astonished? Well you will get used to such surprises with Zeeve.

So to start scaling your networks just head to the dashboard and then hit the Launch Node Button.

Scaling a network using Zeeve is also just as hassle free as it is to create a network. It is again just a 2 step process.

## **Step 1** : Choose the network

All of the networks created by you get listed in the dropdown. 
    Choose the one you want to scale. 

## **Step 2** : Configure the node

Now just fill in the node details and then just configure the cloud details just like you did while creating the network and now in just a few time you will see the requested node joining your network.

If you are scaling a fabric network then you can also specify the type of service node you want to add.
