# Major Blockchain Protocols

This page of this documentation is here just to provide you with a gist of various major protocols and help you give a rough idea around them. So you can choose the one which suits your usecase well.

### HyperLedger Sawtooth

![](images/sawtooth.png) Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise blockchain platform for building distributed ledger applications and networks. The design philosophy targets keeping ledgers distributed and making smart contracts safe, particularly for enterprise use. [Ref.](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/introduction.html)


<!-- ![](images/sawtooth.png) Sawtooth is a modular platform for building, deploying, and running [[Glossary|distributed ledgers]].Â Provide a digital record (such as asset ownership) that is maintained without a central authority or implementation.
Sawtooth is an open source project under Hyper ledger umbrella. Sawtooth is also highly modular. This modularity enables enterprises and consortia to make policy decisions that they are best equipped to make. [Ref.](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/introduction.html) -->

### HyperLedger Fabric

![](images/fabric.png) Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts, that delivers some key differentiating capabilities over other popular distributed ledger or blockchain platforms. [Ref.](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatis.html)



### Ethereum

![](images/ethereum.png) Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain based distributed computing platform and operating system which involves smart contract (business logic coded script) functionality. Ether is a token whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. Ether is a currency used for the transactions between accounts and also used to compensate participating mining nodes for computations performed. [Ref.](https://www.ethereum.org/)
