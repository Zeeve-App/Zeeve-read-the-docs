### **Create a network**

This section will provide you detailed steps for creating a network of **Fantom**.

---
***NOTE*** Please make sure to follow the steps mentioned earlier before proceeding.

---


On the **Network Configuration** page you will have diffrent cards with dffrent network configurations for Fantom, which looks similar to the image provided below.

---
***NOTE:** These cards can be different for your case. Card's configurations totally depend on your purchased subscription.*

---

You can Choose **Managed-AWS** (Zeeve's managed hosting) for infrastructure of your node or you can use your own cloud account (AWS/DO) for hosting of your node.

Choose the configuration you want. Click on the card and follow the steps accordingly.

1. **Network Info** 
Clicking on the card you will be landed to a page similar to the below image. In this section we have to provide network related information for ex- Network Name, Network type etc.

  ![](images/fantomCreateNetwork-1.png)

> *   **Name of Network**: In order to uniquely identify your network, this field requires a unique name for it. Unique over here is in terms of the account in which you are creating your network. In case you have created some network earlier, and now you are trying to create with the same name, then the [Zeeve](https://zeeve.io) platform won't allow you to create it.
> *  **Deployment Type**: This defines the deployment type.
> *   **Type Of Network**
>     *   **MainNet**: This will deploy your network on the network mainnet. This is suggested for deploying production grade ethereum dapps.
>     *   **Testnet**: This is a testnet you can use this for your non production needs like testing or demonstrations.
> *   **Workspace**: 

After providing all the details correctly go to next step by clicking on  **Next Step** button.

2. **Node Configuration**

In this section you have to fill the details of the nodes you want to add to your network.

  ![](images/fantomCreateNetwork-02.png)

> * **Usename & Password**: Choose username and password of your choice. These will be used as rpc api credentials.
> * **Email**: Fill email of yours.
> * **Node Name** In order to identify your nodes, this field will be used. 
> *  **Rpc Server**: RPC, which stands for "Remote Procedure Call," is a group of protocols and interfaces that let us talk to the blockchain system. Through the RPC interface, we can ask for information about the blockchain (such as block number, blocks, node connection, etc.) and send a request for a transaction. 
    >     * **http**: Uses individual HTTP requests and responses for each call, similar to a RESTful API.
    >     * **ws**: WebSocket uses a persistent connection that allows the server to push data to the client.
> * **JSON RPC APIs**: JSON RPC API is bridge that allows dApps to connect to nodes.

After providing the deatils click on **Next step** to go to the last step.

1. **Cloud Configuration**

This is the step for configuration of cloud for your nodes. This step can be different based on your selection of **Network configuration cards**
 
  1. [Manged - AWS](#managed---aws)
  2. [BYOC - AWS](#byoc---aws)
  3. [BYOC - DO](#byoc---do)


---
#### Managed - AWS
---

In case of **Manged - AWS**, you don't have to bother about anything, just to select the region for the network by clicking on **Select Region**.

  ![](images/fantomCreateNetworkMANAGED-AWS.png)

> * **Region**: It indicates the region of cloud service. These regions are the geographic locations where your network instances are going to be hosted. In case of AWS each of its Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Amazon RDS provides you the ability to place resources, such as instances, and data in multiple locations. Resources aren't replicated across AWS Regions unless you do so specifically. [Ref.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html)

---
#### BYOC - AWS
---

In case of **BYOC - AWS**, select the region for the network by clicking on **Select Region**, select the [AWS](./cloud_authorization.md) account you want to use by clicking on **Select Cloud Account**, also choose the instance type as your requirement by clicking on **Select Instance Type**.<br></br>

[Ref.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html)
> * **Cloud Account**: It represent the AWS cloud account that is going to be used for network creation. 
> *   **Type of Instance**: It defines the combination of CPU cores and memory. Choose the configuration which could handle the loads of your network. This parameter is useful for scaling up the network. Type of Instances may vary from cloud to cloud.

#### BYOC - DO
---

In case of **BYOC - DO**, select the region for the network by clicking on **Select Region**, select the [Digital Ocean](./cloud_authorization.md) account you want to use by clicking on **Select Cloud Account**, also choose the instance type as your requirement by clicking on **Select Instance Type**.<br></br>
