# Product Configurations

## Configuring a Product

Configuring a product allows you to do one click deployments for your product in any cloud. It is based on configuring your git repo to a product and making sure certain configuration files are utilized in a standard manner such that Zeeve can automate it to 100%.

To configure a product make sure you have seen the development practices for the relevant blockchain protocol.
- For Hyperledger Fabric
- For Hyperledger Sawtooth

You can choose to keep a product private to you once you have configured it, or you can choose to list it in marketplace.

### Publishing as an idea

A product can be listed as an idea or as full deployable solution. Listing it as an idea allows the user to present it to marketplace before even the product is ready or has been implemented. Listing it as idea doesn't require any git authorizations or development practices to worry about.
