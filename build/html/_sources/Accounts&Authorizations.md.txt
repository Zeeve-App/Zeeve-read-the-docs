## Cloud Authorizations

Zeeve allows you to authorize multiple cloud accounts of yours so as to create networks in the cloud of your choice. You may choose to deploy a some nodes of network on one cloud and extend some nodes of the same on another. This cross cloud deployment maybe a major requirement for your usecase or clients especially for creating/expanding consortiums.

Zeeve supports a list of cloud for you to chcoose from. You can authorize multiple clouds and choose between them at the time of creating networks or nodes. List of supported clouds currently:-

1. AWS
2. Azure
3. Digital Ocean 
4. Google Cloud
5. IBM Cloud

```
Note:- Zeeve doesn't use blockchain services of these clouds, hence is not dependent on any cloud for the level of features it can provide for a protocol. It does use, at times, services like kubernetes and others so as to allow that protocol to exist itself.
