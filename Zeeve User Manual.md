#    Zeeve User Manual

**[Zeeve](https://www.zeeve.io/)** is a product for deploying [[Glossary|blockchain]] over [[Glossary|cloud]] services. We are a group of Blockchain, DLT([[Glossary|Distributed Ledgers]]) & [[Glossary|IOT]] developers and deployment enthusiasts. We have been testing & trying different blockchain protocols since the very inception of them. It is our effort & enthusiasm which has taken us to many hackathons, events and also toward giving shape to several enterprise product ideas. It is during those hackathons, and we realized the need to focus on development & innovation while some automation is taking care of the deployment and updates. It is during those productionalization, we realized that the quality of implementations is being built while some automation is taking care of standards in deployment and quality in execution post-deployment.
The need for such automation drove us to the challenging question of Why not to build it in the first place? And yes, we started then and there with a skilled team, set of ideas and ambitious innovations in the mind.
